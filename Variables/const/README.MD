### Const

- Can only be character, string, boolean, or nummeric value
- Can't be declared using := syntax
- untyped constant takes type needed by its context

# Example

```go
const Pi = 3.14
const (
  StatusOk = 200
  StatusCreated = 201
  StatusAccepted = 202
  StatusNonAuthoritativeInfo = 203
  StatusNoContent = 204
  StatusResetContent = 205
  StatusPartialContent = 206
)
```
